# Evaluation of Changes in Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines Following Implementation of an Analgosedation Guideline in the NICU  

This quality improvement project aims to determine whether the implementation of an analgosedation guideline in our NICU was effective at reducing the use of opioids and benzodiazepines in post-surgical patients. Secondary aims of this project were mortality and length of stay.

Effects of protocol implementation were estimated with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score calculated by binary logistics regression.

There are two SAS script  script for this study:

Analysis00 - load SAS files and formats, recoded variables, generate some descriptive statistics using SAS Macro.  

Analysis01 - Calculated propensity score, assessed the imbalance of data using different weight methods, and conducted linear regression and logistics regression to study the effect of protocal implementation on the use of opioids and benzodiazepines drug.
